description: |
  The Tinker App provides basic functionality to interact with a Particle device's digital and analog pins.
  Users can read and write to pins, control LEDs, and monitor sensors through the Particle Cloud functions.
  It includes functions for digital and analog read/write capabilities, making it an ideal starting point for
  learning how to interact with Particle hardware.
